# WikiSQLv2

Patched and improved version of the original large crowd-sourced dataset for developing natural language interfaces for relational databases, [WikiSQL](https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL).

## ðŸ“‚ Content

Inside the *dataset* folder, you will find files in `.jsonl`, `.sql`, and `.txt` formats.

The dataset is split into three partitions:

- **dev** â€” for validating a model  
- **test** â€” for testing a model  
- **train** â€” for training a model  

### File Structure

For each partition, the main folder contains:

- **`{partition}.jsonl`** â€” natural language queries, corresponding SQL queries, and the table ID each query refers to.  
- **`{partition}_tables.jsonl`** â€” table data (one table per line), including header names, data types, and rows.  
- **`{partition}_results.jsonl`** â€” results from `{partition}.jsonl` queries, including both query output and an example of a correct SQL query.  
- **`{partition}_results_case_insensitive.jsonl`** â€” same as `{partition}_results.jsonl`, but ignores case sensitivity for string-type SQL elements (column names and string literals in `WHERE` clauses).  

### Database Creation

The dataset also includes the *database_creation_sql* folder, containing SQL scripts (`.sql` and `.txt` formats, one query per line) to:

1. Create tables for each partition  
2. Populate them with corresponding data
